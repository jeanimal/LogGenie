      "category": "malware|phishing|data_exfiltration|brute_force|suspicious_traffic|policy_violation|other",

}

Focus on:
- Blocked requests (action: "BLOCK") which may indicate attack attempts
- Allowed requests to malicious domains (action: "ALLOW" with suspicious URLs)
- Unusual destination URLs or domains (especially containing "malicious", "phishing", "fraud")
- Category mismatches (legitimate URLs categorized as malware/phishing)
- High-risk categories (malware, phishing sites)
- Suspicious access patterns and user behavior
- Unusual traffic patterns or volumes
- Geographic or temporal anomalies
- Protocol or encoding anomalies

Pay special attention to:
- ANY request to URLs containing "malicious" regardless of action
- Requests with ALLOW action to obviously dangerous domains
- Category inconsistencies that suggest data corruption or evasion
